## How to use it

You need a local server to run it, install one of your choice, I use `static-server`

```
$ npm install -g static-server
```

Then just run static-server in the project folder

```
$ static-server
```

And open the browser in the url the server is serving at

```
http://localhost:9080
```

Present it with Passion!
